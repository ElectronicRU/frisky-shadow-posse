# frisky-shadow-posse
An online collectible card game project. The name's maybe temporary, or maybe not.

## Project structure
As of now, I'm undecided on what to do the frontend in, although HTML/Yaws certainly seems like a decent option.

For the backend, Erlang is going to be used, with Mnesia as the database (it seems to fit for the needs, at least initially; the table structure isn't going to be complex and the tables aren't going to be vast).
